Analyzing Road Accident datasetÂ¶
In this Project we Analyse The "Road Accident" dataset to compile statistical information regarding traffic incidents.
It encompasses variables such as accident types, locations, vehicles involved, casualties, and contributing factors 
like weather or road conditions. Analyzing this data aids in understanding patterns, improving safety measures, and 
developing effective traffic management strategies.
